## Carbon Footprint Calculater based on the Vehicle and Distance Traveled


This repo is the frontend of a project built by CodeHackers team at [Seoul Tech Impact Hackaton](https://www.seoultechimpact.com/) 


## User Story
 
A member of our team, a Ph.D. student researching air pollution in Korea, collected data on the carbon emission amounts from specific car models for his research project. This dataset included around 40,000 car models.

When we looked up online calculators and available APIs, we found that existing carbon footprint calculators only accounted for general vehicle types like trains, cars, motorbikes, and planes. __They didn't provide data for specific car models__ 

ðŸ‘€Â We realized that a more detailed calculator would have been useful, especially for those looking to purchase a new car and wanting to understand its environmental impact.

So we developed our own **carbon footprint calculator** for specific car models.
